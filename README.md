# Can we predict the winning team at the technical timeout?
Experimenting with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the winning team (or player) when the total points are equal to 21 i.e. we have reached the technical timeout.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to not only gain furhter insight into the stats that are being collected as part of the High Level Beach (HLB) organzation, but to also:
* **gain experience using more ML models** which should be easy and quick to implement since the dataset is small and the features are limited
* **use tests** to understand code coverage and produce more professional projects

## Resources
[Testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/#automating-the-execution-of-your-tests)
* Code Coverage
  * [Quick Start](https://docs.codecov.com/docs)
  * [Tutorial](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/github-tutorial)
  * [Python+Github+Codecov Example](https://about.codecov.io/blog/python-code-coverage-using-github-actions-and-codecov/)


This work was conducted as a part of the High Level Beach (HLB) organization.
